# An-Ensemble-ML-model-in-Detection-of-Phishing-Websites-

Malicious attackers have considered COVID-19 as an opportunity to launch attacks for financial gains and to promote their evil intents. 
Healthcare systems are being attacked with ransomware and resources such as patient's records confidentiality, and integrity is being compromised. 
People are falling prey to phishing attacks through COVID-19 related content. We have tried to identify different aspects of cyber security that have been threatened during this time.  
In this project we are focusing on detecting the phishing websites 
 
 
 We have used the following algorithms to build a model to detect phishing websites.  
Decision Tree Model  

Support Vector Machine  

XGBoost Model  

Bagging Tree 

Ada Boost 

Grid Search
